👋 Hello! I’m Juan Pablo (@JuanPabloMonDi), a mathematician and statistician from the National University of Colombia. Master student in Demography at Unicamp, Brazil.

I created this GitHub for my university studies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, I have seen it as an opportunity to share some of my projects with everyone. Some repositories have been developed for academic papers, and others are made just for fun.   

For last, I would like to give a few details about myself:
- I love maths and statistics, and I am interested in all kinds of areas, from their applications to their theory; My main interest lately has been demography, I also like abstract algebra, lie algebra, topology, and number theory, as well as many areas that don't have much to do with programming (for now).
- I can have advanced and fluent conversations in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Fortunately, thanks to all the translation tools available on the internet, I can communicate in every language with a bit of extra effort.
-  I researched a while about the New coefficient of correlation proposed by Sourav Chatterjee (2021) and its performance on time series.
